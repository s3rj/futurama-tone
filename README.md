IBM Watson Tone Analysis

General Tone Assessment
Analyze shorter web data, such as email messages or tweets, or longer documents, such as articles or blog posts. Monitor social media to understand what customers are saying about a brand and to determine whom to target with specific messaging.

It detects three types of tones, including emotion (anger, disgust, fear, joy and sadness), social propensities (openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and emotional range), and language styles (analytical, confident and tentative) from text.
